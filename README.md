# Relational recurrent neural networks

This is an attempted reproduction of the model described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822). However, it is not a working reproduction yet. The relational LSTM model implemented in `relational_recurrent.py` does not seem to perform better than an ordinary LSTM on the N-th farthest task described in the paper. Feel free to fork and let me know if you can spot any mistakes in my implementation and come up with a successful replication of the results reported in the paper.
